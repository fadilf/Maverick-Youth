                    “Older men declare war. But it is youth that must fight and die”
– Herbert Hoover.<br><br>
A phrase, not uncommon in present day era, is ‘Youth Empowerment’. It is a phrase that is popular with the media, a commonly used  rhetoric by politicians, and an overused statement in school seminars. That being said, the opportunities present for the youth to express their opinions openly on issues that concern them are minimal, if not non-existent.<br><br>
This is where Maverick Youth  comes into play. This is a platform where any high school or university student can post their views on global and regional issues, thought provoking ideas or topics that are of great concern to them.  It gives them a powerful literary voice. A voice that can truly enable them to change the world for the better and do full justice to the phrase ‘Youth Empowerment’.<br><br>
